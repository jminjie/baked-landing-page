        <div class="description">
            When she doesn’t receive the scholarship that would send her to her
            dream school, habitual overachiever Jane Huang, with the help of
            her best friend, joins forces with the class degenerate to build
            the greatest drug empire ever run by high schoolers. Kept in the
            dark are Jane’s parents, whose inability to cope with their
            daughter leaving for college while maintaining a profit at their
            struggling Chinese bakery drives them to pry and potentially
            unravel Jane’s web of lies.
